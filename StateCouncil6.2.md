# Enforcement and Judicial Process policy

##  Principles

The Queensland Greens believe that:
1. All individuals have a right to a safe, peaceful existence, free from harm and fear of violence.
1. Crime prevention strategies, programs, and education must be evidence-based, proactive, community-led and holistic.
1. We must focus on building up community-led systems that prevent, reduce, and better address violence and harm in our communities, rather than relying on law enforcement, prisons and child protection authorities to resolve them.
1. The over representation of First Nations peoples in the criminal justice system in Queensland is unacceptable and avoidable, and must be ended.
1. The over representation of disabled people in the criminal justice system in Queensland is unacceptable and avoidable, and must be ended.
1. Coercive control is unacceptable in our society and constitutes a significant and devastating part of domestic violence. A change in cultural attitudes to coercive control is crucial to reducing domestic violence.
1. Substance use is a health issue, not a criminal issue. Drug use and possession should be decriminalised.
1. Queensland should have strong effective evidence-based weapon control.

### Youth Justice
1. Youth justice policies should be guided by restorative and transformative justice principles, with a focus on education and rehabilitation, not punishment.
1. The age of criminal responsibility should be no lower than 14 years.
1. Young people have the right to a safe and happy home, free from abuse and neglect.
1. Young people have the right to community and to culturally appropriate community justice programs and services.

## Aims

The Queensland Greens will:
1. Prioritise and fund programs that promote:
    1. A reduction in the structural circumstances that create crime.
    1. Prevention strategies - including:
        1. Access to culturally and linguistically appropriate literacy and numeracy programs as well as wider education, training and work opportunities;
        1. The creation and expansion of publicly-funded drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation centres, that are voluntary, free, accessible and linguistically and culturally appropriate;
        1. Breaking the cycle of social disadvantage that may result in child abuse and neglect, by providing equitable services to address systemic and structural oppression that creates disadvantage.
        1. Specific services for First Nations peoples, culturally and linguistically diverse people, disabled people, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
        1. Voluntary early intervention programs, such as community based, residential, counselling and other support services.
        1. Post release services to prevent re-offending. Post-release services need to be properly funded and fully accessible in all communities - urban, regional and remote - and culturally appropriate.
        1. Services that are led by lived expertise, widely available, accessible, and free.
1. Address domestic violence by:
    1. Introducing an adequately funded and integrated approach to combating domestic violence and sexual assault, with services available throughout the state.
    1. Implementing evidence-based ongoing prevention, education, and accountability programs aimed at law enforcement and judiciary regarding domestic violence including coercive control. These programs should be led by frontline services and informed by the lived expertise of victim survivors and oppressed peoples.
    1. Providing protection, safety, and equality for young people in the prevention of and response to domestic violence, including access to their community and to culturally appropriate programs and services, in accordance with the Human Rights Act (QLD) and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. Priority must be given to family support, including the option to stay with extended family and/or within their communities.

1. Continue to support a well-resourced and independent Crime Statistics and Research unit within the Queensland Government Statistician's Office.
1. Support ongoing research of the over incarceration of First Nations people, with an oversight committee composed of First Nations peoples and community groups led by and for First Nations peoples to be specifically implemented at federal and state level.
1. Support ongoing research of the over incarceration of disabled people, with an oversight committee composed of disabled people and community groups led by and for disabled people to be specifically implemented at federal and state level.

# Law Enforcement and Judicial Process Policy

    1. Protects the community
    1. Reduces the social impacts of crime
    1. Addresses the causes of crime
    1. Protects the human rights of victims, suspects, and perpetrators and
    1. Offers a range of interventions in addition to loss of liberty.
1. Imprisonment should be a measure of last resort and focussed on rehabilitation.
1. Loss of liberty, including custodial interventions, temporary holds, remand, and arrests should only be used in situations where the person is a risk to the community.
1. People should not be held in remand for simple or nonviolent offences.
1. The following basic principles of criminal justice must be protected:
    1. Freedom from prolonged detention without charge or trial.
    1. The presumption in favour of bail.
    1. The principle of double jeopardy.
    1. The legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
    1. The right to a trial by jury for all serious indictable offences.
    1. The requirement for unanimous jury verdicts.
    1. The independence of the judiciary from political interference.
    1. Judicial discretion in sentencing and bail.
    1. The freedom from allegation based on association.
1. Victims of crime should have improved, timely, accessible, linguistically and culturally appropriate compensation, counselling and other such measures, accessible in all regions and also accessible in terms of financial access and disability access.
1. The state must be responsible for providing support services for people and their families adversely affected by crime.
1. Domestic violence, including coercive control, requires an integrated system of response led by community organisations.
1. Programs for prevention of incarceration, programs in custody and programs for newly released incarcerated people who are First Nations people need to be initiated and led by First Nations peoples.
1. All people in closed environments, such as institutions, prisons, and psychiatric facilities, have a right to a safe, peaceful existence, free from harm and fear of violence.
1. All people in closed environments must receive appropriate care relating to their gender, sexual orientation, culture, religion, disability, and other axes of oppression.

1. We must address the structural flaws within the existing child protection system fail which children and families and do not address the underlying causes of crime.
1. Children failed by the child protection system are funnelled into the justice system, and this must be ended.

### Law Enforcement
1. Law enforcement should be restructured to focus on core responsibilities for which they are suited and trained.
1. Law enforcement and judicial process is to remain free from political influence, and should be separate from each other.
1. Law enforcement should utilise de-escalation tactics and seek to successfully resolve situations without the use of force, firearms or tasers wherever possible.
1. The hiring of police by private interests, or any other form of privatisation of policing services, must be prohibited.
1. People convicted of corruption, exploitation, or abuses of power should be prevented from holding authority positions within law enforcement or the judicial process system.
1. Law enforcement must not be used to prevent protests or intimidate protestors.
1. Law enforcement must not intimidate, manipulate, or coerce witnesses or defendants.

### Conclusion
1. Imprisonment exacerbates the social conditions that lead to crime, and is more likely to result in recidivism, therefore efforts should be made to find alternatives.
1. The current carceral justice system uses resources that would be better used to reduce rates of crime and imprisonment.
1. We need to focus on building up holistic life-sustaining systems that prevent, reduce, and better address harm, in order to create a world where we do not need to rely on law enforcement, prisons, and child protection authorities to reduce and address violence and harm in our communities.

# Law Enforcement and Judicial Process Policy

## Principles

The Queensland Greens believe that:
1. Law enforcement and judicial processes should be guided by restorative and transformative justice principles, with a focus on education and rehabilitation.
1. A just and effective criminal justice system:
    1. Protects the community
    1. Reduces the social impacts of crime
    1. Addresses the causes of crime
    1. Protects the human rights of victims, suspects, and perpetrators and
    1. Offers a range of interventions in addition to loss of liberty.
1. Imprisonment should be a measure of last resort and focussed on rehabilitation.
1. Loss of liberty, including custodial interventions, temporary holds, remand, and arrests should only be used in situations where the person is a risk to the community.
1. People should not be held in remand for minor, nonviolent offences.
1. The following basic principles of criminal justice must be protected:
    1. Freedom from prolonged detention without charge or trial.
    1. The presumption in favour of bail.
    1. The principle of double jeopardy.
    1. The legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
    1. The right to a trial by jury for all serious indictable offences.
    1. The requirement for unanimous jury verdicts.
    1. The independence of the judiciary from political interference.
    1. Judicial discretion in sentencing and bail.
    1. The freedom from allegation based on association.
1. Victims of crime should have improved, timely, accessible, linguistically and culturally appropriate compensation, counselling and other such measures, accessible in all regions and also accessible in terms of financial access and disability access.
1. The state must be responsible for providing support services for people and their families adversely affected by crime.
1. Domestic violence, including coercive control, requires an integrated system of response led by community organisations.
1. Programs for prevention of incarceration, programs in custody and programs for newly released incarcerated people who are First Nations people need to be initiated and led by First Nations peoples.
1. All people in closed environments, such as institutions, prisons, and psychiatric facilities, have a right to a safe, peaceful existence, free from harm and fear of violence.
1. People in closed environments must receive appropriate care relating to their gender, sexual orientation, culture, religion, disability, and other axes of oppression.
1. Any prisons, remand facilities or jails should be publicly owned and run.
1. The state must provide support to alleged offenders until judicial processes are concluded.
1. Activists and whistleblowers must have strong affirmative legal protections against raids, intimidation, and legal threats.
1. All individuals have a right to privacy, including freedom from arbitrary searches.
1. Incarcerated people have the right to work fair working conditions and compensation at full award rates.

### Youth Justice and Child Protection
1. We should aspire to have no youth incarceration.
1. We must address the structural flaws within the existing child protection system which fail children and families and do not address the underlying causes of crime.
1. Children failed by the child protection system are unacceptably and avoidably over-represented in the justice system in Queensland, and this must be ended.

### Law Enforcement
1. Law enforcement should be restructured to focus on core responsibilities for which they are suited and trained.
1. Law enforcement and judicial process is to remain free from political influence, and should be separate from each other.
1. Law enforcement should utilise de-escalation tactics and seek to successfully resolve situations without the use of force, firearms or tasers wherever possible.
1. The hiring of police by private interests, or any other form of privatisation of policing services, must be prohibited.
1. People convicted of corruption, exploitation, or abuses of power should be prevented from holding authority positions within law enforcement or the judicial process system.
1. Law enforcement must not be used to prevent protests or intimidate protestors.
1. Law enforcement must not intimidate, manipulate, or coerce witnesses or defendants.

### Conclusion
1. Imprisonment exacerbates the social conditions that lead to crime, and is more likely to result in recidivism, therefore efforts should be made to find alternatives.
1. The current carceral justice system uses resources that would be better used to reduce rates of crime and imprisonment.
1. In order to create a world where we do not need to rely on law enforcement, prisons, and child protection authorities we must focus on building systems to address the causes of violence and harm in our communities.

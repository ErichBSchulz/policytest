# Crime Prevention and Youth Justice

##  Principles

The Queensland Greens believe that:
1. All individuals have a right to a safe, peaceful existence, free from harm and fear of violence.
1. Crime prevention strategies, programs, and education must be evidence-based, proactive, community-led and holistic.
1. We must focus on building up community-led systems that prevent, reduce, and better address violence and harm in our communities, rather than relying on law enforcement, prisons and child protection authorities to resolve them.
1. The over representation of First Nations peoples in the criminal justice system in Queensland is unacceptable and avoidable, and must be ended.
1. Criminalisation of disability, mental illness and substance use results in the over-representation of disabled people in the criminal justice system and the government must deliver effective services to prevent this.
1. Coercive control is unacceptable in our society and constitutes a significant and devastating part of domestic violence. A change in cultural attitudes to coercive control is crucial to reducing domestic violence.
1. Substance use is a health issue, not a criminal issue. Drug use and personal possession should be legalised or decriminalised.
1. Queensland should have strong effective evidence-based weapon control.

### Youth Justice
1. Youth justice policies should be guided by restorative and transformative justice principles, with a focus on education and rehabilitation, not punishment.
1. The age of criminal responsibility should be no lower than 14 years.
1. Young people have the right to a safe and happy home, free from abuse and neglect.
1. Young people have the right to community and to culturally appropriate community justice programs and services.

## Aims

The Queensland Greens will:
1. Prioritise and fund programs that promote:
    1. A reduction in the structural circumstances that create crime.
    1. Prevention strategies - including:
        1. Access to culturally and linguistically appropriate literacy and numeracy programs as well as wider education, training and work opportunities;
        1. The creation and expansion of publicly-funded drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation centres (including youth specific centres), that are voluntary, free, accessible and linguistically and culturally appropriate;
        1. Breaking the cycle of social disadvantage that may result in child abuse and neglect, by providing equitable services to address systemic and structural oppression that creates disadvantage.
        1. Specific services for First Nations peoples, culturally and linguistically diverse people, disabled people, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
        1. Voluntary early intervention programs, such as community based, residential, counselling and other support services.
        1. Post release services to prevent re-offending that are culturally appropriate and fully accessible in all communities.
        1. Services that are led by lived expertise, widely available, accessible, and free.
1. Address domestic violence by:
    1. Introducing an adequately funded and integrated approach to combating domestic violence and sexual assault, with services available throughout the state.
    1. Implementing evidence-based ongoing prevention, education, and accountability programs aimed at law enforcement and judiciary regarding domestic violence including coercive control that are led by frontline services and informed by the lived expertise of victim survivors and oppressed peoples.
    1. Providing protection, safety, and equality for young people in the prevention of and response to domestic violence, including access to their community and to culturally appropriate programs and services, in accordance with the Human Rights Act (QLD) and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. Priority must be given to family support, including the option to stay with extended family and/or within their communities.
    1. Increasing educational campaigns about domestic and intimate partner violence that incorporate an understanding of intersectionality, including support, programs, awareness, and training with acknowledgement of LGBTIQA+ people, men, disabled, elderly, and youth survivors.
1. Introduce specific programs to combat violence and harm against people on the basis of their race, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation, intersex status, disability, or other marginalisation. These programs must be led by people who have experienced the relevant marginalisation.
1. Engage a study to determine whether, in line with overseas studies, hate crime laws in Australia disproportionately incarcerate marginalised people (such as First Nations, culturally and linguistically diverse, disabled, and LGBTIQA+ people).
1. Continue to support a well-resourced and independent Crime Statistics and Research unit within the Queensland Government Statistician's Office.
1. Adopt law enforcement reforms and other social measures to address the over-representation of First Nations people in the criminal justice system.
1. Reform inaccessible judicial and legal processes that exclude and disadvantage people within the legal system in order to address the disproportionately negative outcomes for marginalised people.
1. Maintain the decriminalisation of sex work.
1. Implement drug law reform including the full decriminalisation or legalisation of drug use.
1. Support the ongoing provision and expansion of drug harm reduction programs including safe consumption facilities, drug checking/pill testing facilities, Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST), free take-home naloxone, and needle and syringe programs. These services must be accessible in all regions.
1. Support trials of alternatives to the carceral system in communities in Queensland. Trials must be performed with full participatory community engagement, involvement of all community stakeholders, and with a shared power structure.
1. Ensure sufficient funding for independent, free legal support and advocacy organisations including Legal Aid, Community Legal Centres, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services to: * Increase capacity for and accessibility of advice, representation, community legal education, and law reform; and * Increase the diversity of representation available.
1. Provide sufficient funding to compliance bodies to ensure non-government legal and advocacy services are independent and meeting ethical and service standards.
1. Increase the scope of independent legal support and advocacy organisations so that they are able to advise on more areas of law.
1. Where necessary, provide appropriate support to allow for independent legal support and advocacy organisations to ethically represent both parties in a dispute.
1. Strengthen legal protections for good-faith research. Discovering or publishing institutional problems benefits society, and must not be criminalised.

### Youth Justice
1. Empower and support youth advocates to advise and engage in decision-making that impacts young people.
1. Fund evidence-based programs to engage young people in prosocial and development activities in their communities and schools, and provide counselling and support programs for young people, as an alternative to the carceral system.
1. Fund evidence-based, community-led programs for First Nations young people.

### Gun Control
1. Continue controls over gun use and ownership by:
    1. Banning the importation, ownership, possession and use of semi-automatic handguns with exemptions for Government owned guns.
    1. Maintaining amnesties on the surrender and buy-back of licensed firearms in perpetuity.
    1. Maintaining public education campaigns in support of the gun buy-back scheme.
    1. Requiring QPS to accurately monitor firearm ownership and safe storage of firearms.
    1. Removing firearms from private security agencies.

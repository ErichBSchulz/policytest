# Crime Prevention and Judicial Process

## Principles

The Queensland Greens believe that:

1. All individuals have a right to a safe, peaceful and ecologically sustainable existence, free from crime and fear of violence.

1. A just and effective criminal justice system protects the community, reduces the social impacts of crime, addresses the causes of crime, protects the human rights of victims, suspects and perpetrators and offers a range of interventions in addition to loss of liberty.

1. The government must deliver a full range of services to prevent the over-representation in the criminal justice system of people with intellectual disabilities, mental illnesses and substance addiction.

1. A reduction in the use of custodial interventions for remand and sentencing will release public funds that should be directed to the prevention of crime and the resolution of underlying social problems that give rise to criminal behaviour.

1. The hiring of police by private interests, or any other form of privatisation of policing services, must be prohibited.

1. Incarceration should be a measure of last resort and focussed on rehabilitation. Any prisons, remand facilities or jails should be publicly owned and run.

1. Victims of crime should have improved access to compensation, counselling and other such measures.

1. The over representation of Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander people in the criminal justice system in Queensland must be addressed.

1. The following basic principles of criminal justice must be protected:

    1. Freedom from prolonged detention without charge or trial.

    1. The presumption in favour of bail.

    1. The principle of double jeopardy.

    1. The legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty.

    1. The right to a trial by jury for all serious indictable offences.

    1. The requirement for unanimous jury verdicts.

    1. The independence of the judiciary from political interference.

    1. Judicial discretion in sentencing and bail.

    1. The freedom from allegation based on association.

1. That criminal justice policies should be based on rational, evidence-based, non-emotive approach to issues rather than on simplistic ‘law and order’ campaigns.

1. Coercive control is unacceptable in our society and constitutes a significant and devastating part of domestic violence. A change in cultural attitudes to coercive control is crucial to reducing domestic violence.

1. All individuals have a right to a safe, peaceful existence, free from crime and fear of violence.

1. Queensland should have strong effective gun control.

    1. The audio and video attachments on Tasers are operational at all times and activated when a Taser is withdrawn from its holster.
